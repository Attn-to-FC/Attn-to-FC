Ref Comment: "disposes of the operating system resources associated with the clipboard"
Astattendgru prediction: "disposes the dialog"
Attn-to-fc prediction: "disposes of the operating system resources associated with the clipboard"

Here's the tdats for this function: "public void dispose if is disposed return if display get thread thread current thread swing utilities is event dispatch thread dnd error swt error thread invalid access display null"
The words system and clipboard were present in other functions in the file. 
The word thread could possibly explain hoe the model predicted operating system, but not the whole thing correctly, including the part about clipboard without seeing it from the other functions.

We look at the heatmap at stopword 4, which is right before the attn-to-fc model predicts 'operating' and stopword 10, which is right before the attn-to-fc model predicts 'clipboard.'
At both instances, the file context attention looks most at function 7.
Function 7 has both the words system and clipboard in it, which explains the heatmap.
